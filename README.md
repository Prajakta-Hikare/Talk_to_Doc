Problem Statement : Talk to your documents (and get answers from them)

Develop an efficient system that can be used to extract information, ask questions, and get answers from huge documents where reading entire document is not effective and time consuming. Questions can be asked in the text format or using voice. Implementing voice is an added feature though. Develop a web-based application which allows user to upload documents or system can also use pre-defined documents for the sake of simplifying the flow. Once the document is available, web application will provide a chat-like feature where user can ask questions about document and get answers back.

Overview : 
This project aims to make a LLM Model that takes a document as an input and make it answerable. It will be locally hosted. It can interact with user.
